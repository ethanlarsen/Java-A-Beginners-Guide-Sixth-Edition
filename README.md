# Java-A-Beginners-Guide-Sixth-Edition
Herbert Schildt's Book with Chapter Examples

This book is a great guide to understanding main java principles and a reference for anyone looking to get started with programming in Java SE (JDK8).

These files are from the chapter examples which I've followed along with, they are a great reference and may save you some time if you do not whish to type them yourself.

I received this book from a friend who used it for the OCP Java Programmer I exam and I hope these files can help someone else. The book is about $8.00 on Amazon used and is a perfect gift for anyone looking to expand their programming language knowledge and pallete. It definitely helped me explore more topics and gain more indepth knowledge than my master's java book ever did. (ha)

Cheers,
