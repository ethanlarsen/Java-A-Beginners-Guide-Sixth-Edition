# Java-A-Beginners-Guide-Sixth-Edition
Herbert Schildt's Book with Chapter Examples

This book is a great guide to understanding main java principles and a reference for anyone looking to get started with programming in Java SE (JDK8).

It definitely helped me explore more topics and gain more indepth knowledge than my master's java book did. I received this book from a friend who used it for the OCP Java Programmer I exam and I hope these files can help someone else.

Cheers,

Ethan
